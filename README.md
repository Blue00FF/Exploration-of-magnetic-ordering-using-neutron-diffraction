# Exploration-of-magnetic-ordering-using-neutron-diffraction
In this report, we are analyzing data from neutron diffraction data collected at ISIS, the UKâ€™s national neutron source, since it is a kind of radiation sensitive to magnetism. The material used is methylammonium cobalt(II) formate (CH3NH3Co(HCO2)3).

This is the second report that I made as part of the Introduction to Scientific Computing Course as part of my Theoretical Physics degree course.
